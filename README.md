# Activity Classification: Smartphone Gyroscope Data
* Classified three different everyday activities (walking, sitting, and standing) with over 95% accuracy using a MLP neural network trained on smartphone gyroscope data.
* Project was done as a team class project in Spring 2019 while earning my Master's degree in applied mathematics. I have since edited the code and cleaned it up a bit for presentation here.
* See Report.pdf file to read a full report and analysis of the project. The vast majority of the code is written by me using tensorflow. Large amounts of the report were written by my teammates using LaTex for typesetting.

## Dataset
* The dataset used can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/human-activity-recognition-with-smartphones).
* The number of classes used was reduced to three (walking, sitting, and standing).
